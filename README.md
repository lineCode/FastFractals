# Fast Fractals
A GPU-accelerated fractal generator and renderer.

Fractals are generated by CUDA kernels, rendered through OpenGL, and presented in a Qt5 GUI application.

![Fast Fractals](doc/fastfractals.gif)

Tech used: *CUDA, the cuRAND library, C++ (Qt Style), the Qt framework, OpenGL, and a variant on the MVC design pattern*

Comments and constructive criticism are welcome.

## Features

- Generate fractal structures containing millions of points within milliseconds
- Up to a 500x performance increase over single threaded generation
- Fractal points color-coded by their target IFS mapping
- See how kernel timing is affected by GPU thread count and the number of points generated
- 15 example fractals to experiment with (see [usage](#usage-and-explanation) to construct more)
